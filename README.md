# Facturera - Restaurant Management System with Tkinter

This is a desktop application project developed in Python using Tkinter. The goal of the application is to allow waitresses to manage customer orders in a restaurant, split the bill among individuals if necessary, calculate the total, and generate an invoice with a unique number and the current date.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for the graphical user interface)
- Standard Python functions (such as file handling and calculations)

## Features

- **Order entry by table**: Allows the waitress to enter items for each table.
- **Bill splitting**: The waitress can split the total bill among multiple people if needed.
- **Calculator**: If additional calculations are required, the app includes an integrated calculator.
- **Invoice generation**: Once the order is complete, an invoice is generated with a unique number and the issue date in a `.txt` file.
